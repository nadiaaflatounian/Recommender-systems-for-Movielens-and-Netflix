# Netflix Movie Recommendation System README

## Overview
This script outlines the process of creating a movie recommendation system using the Netflix dataset. It emphasizes feature engineering, genre analysis, similarity computations, and model evaluation. The system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings and genre preferences.

## Key Components

- **Data Loading**: Initial loading of Netflix movies data.
- **Feature Engineering**: One-hot encoding of movie genres, generation of interaction features among genres, and calculation of genre popularity and rarity scores.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Sampling of the dataset and splitting into training, validation, and testing sets.
- **Similarity Measures**: Calculation of item similarity using cosine similarity based on user ratings and genre information.
- **Rating Prediction**: Implementation of a function to predict movie ratings for a given user, considering both item similarity and user-item interactions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on both training and testing sets. Includes a process for tuning the number of neighbors (`k`) using a validation set.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Provision of movie recommendations for a user, with a fallback strategy involving random recommendations when the data is sparse.

## Technologies Used

- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and numerical computations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities and metrics.
- SciPy for additional statistical computations.

## Execution Steps

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the Netflix dataset is available.
2. Run the script to perform data preprocessing, similarity computations, and model evaluation.
3. Utilize the prediction and recommendation functions to generate personalized movie suggestions.

## Conclusion

This system demonstrates the application of similarity measures and bias correction to enhance the quality of movie recommendations. It is a foundational step towards building more sophisticated recommendation engines.
