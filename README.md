Building a recommender system 
**Netflix Recommendation System**

This repository contains the code for building a recommendation system using the Netflix dataset. The recommendation system is implemented using various methods, each represented in different files.

### Files Overview:

1. **Netflix_Cleaning.ipynb**: This notebook combines datasets and performs data cleaning, including handling missing values.

2. **Netflix_EDA.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to gain insights into the dataset.

3. **User_Based_CF_KNN_Prediction.ipynb**: Implements User-Based Collaborative Filtering using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) prediction technique.

4. **User_Based_CF_KNN_Classification.ipynb**: Implements User-Based Collaborative Filtering using KNN classification technique.

5. **Other_Recommendation_Methods.ipynb**: This notebook contains other recommendation methods implemented for comparison and evaluation.

### Usage:

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Run the notebooks in the following order:
   - Netflix_Cleaning.ipynb
   - Netflix_EDA.ipynb
   - User_Based_CF_KNN_Prediction.ipynb
   - User_Based_CF_KNN_Classification.ipynb
   - Other_Recommendation_Methods.ipynb

2. Ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.

3. Adjust parameters and experiment with different methods as needed.

### Note:

- Each notebook provides detailed explanations and insights into the implementation and results.
- Feel free to modify the code according to specific requirements or to experiment with different techniques.
