Building a recommender system 


**Netflix and MovieLens Recommendation System**

This repository contains the code for building a recommendation system using the Netflix and MovieLens dataset. The recommendation system is implemented using various methods, each represented in different files.

### Files Overview:

1. **Netflix Cleaning.ipynb**: This notebook combines datasets and performs data cleaning, including handling missing values.

2. **Netflix EDA.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to gain insights into the dataset. at the finla part prepared dataset for building recommender system is saved.

3. **Netflix_CFuserbased.ipynb**: Implements User-Based Collaborative Filtering using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) prediction and classification technique on Netflix dataset.

4. **MovieLens_CFuserbased.ipynb**: Implements User-Based Collaborative Filtering using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) prediction and classification technique on MovieLens dataset.

5. **Netflix SVD.ipynb**: This notebook contains SVD and SVD++  methods implemented for recommender system on Netflix dataset.

6. **MovieLens_SVD_FinalVersion.ipynb**: This notebook contains SVD and SVD++  methods implemented for recommender system on MovieLens dataset.

### Usage:

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Run the notebooks in the following order:
   - Netflix_Cleaning.ipynb
   - Netflix_EDA.ipynb
   - Other notebooks using saved file in Netflix_EDA.ipynb

2. Ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.

3. Adjust parameters and experiment with different methods as needed.

### Note:

- Each notebook provides detailed explanations and insights into the implementation and results.
- Feel free to modify the code according to specific requirements or to experiment with different techniques.
