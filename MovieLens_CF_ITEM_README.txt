# Movie Recommendation System README

## Overview
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system utilizing the MovieLens dataset. It focuses on analyzing user ratings and movie genres to provide personalized movie recommendations. Key features include data preprocessing, genre analysis, and implementing similarity measures for recommendation.

## Key Functions and Steps

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Merge user ratings and movie details, handle missing values, and perform one-hot encoding on movie genres.
- **Genre Analysis**: Calculate the number of genres per movie and explore the correlation between movie ratings and the number of genres.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate interaction features among genres and compute metrics like genre popularity and rarity scores.
- **Similarity Measures**: Use cosine similarity and Manhattan distance to compute similarities between movies based on user ratings and genre information.
- **Model Evaluation**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE.
- **Recommendation**: Predict user ratings for unseen movies and recommend top movies based on these predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models and evaluations
- SciPy for statistical analysis

## Running the Project
Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed. Run the script to preprocess data, evaluate the model, and generate movie recommendations.

## Conclusion
This system offers a solid foundation for building a sophisticated movie recommendation engine. It showcases the importance of feature engineering and similarity measures in improving recommendation quality.
